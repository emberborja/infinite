Infinite Industries Web App
=========================

Preliminary sketch of Infinite Industries.
The code is super hacky and ugly but allows us to protoype general patterns and see
how real live people are trying to interact with it.
<br>
Lots of technical TODOs and some feature ideas https://trello.com/b/N3YSDIuB/featurecreatures

## NOTES

Lists can be of three types:
1. following - users already follows the list - user can unfollow
2. mine - list belongs to the user
3. none - not 1 or 2 - user can follow

Lists can be in two states:
1. live - user is actively supporting the list
2. abandoned - user chooses to abandon the list -- need to figure out exact end of life strategy ;) -- user can not just delete a list

Lists can be:
1. Public -- viewed by everyone
2. Private -- viewed by the author only


TODO:

add vue-router to the project
