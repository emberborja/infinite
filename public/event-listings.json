The film was programmed by Phill Kisling, who will introduce the show.<br /><br />At Midnight I&rsquo;ll Take Your Soul is a 1964 Brazilian horror film that is the first instance of the character known as Z&eacute; do Caix&atilde;o or translated to english Coffin Joe. The film starts with an old witch telling us to not watch this evil film, to turn away but together we will not heed her superstitious ramblings! Together we will witness the horrific acts of Z&eacute; do Caix&atilde;o as he searches for the perfect woman to carry on his evil bloodline, in attempt to defy God himself!</p>",
