    <h1>Legal</h1>

    <p class="statement">
      We care about your rights and your understanding of the legal framework of the services you use. So we are not hiding this information behind some out of the way link on our site. Here is a human-readable summary of the info in the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Be a good human.</em> Don’t submit text or images that you don’t have legal rights to. We are very tolerant of the definitions of “derivative work” and “non-commercial use” but if the original copyright holders take issue with your usage of their material, we will take the content down.
    </p>

    <p>
      We reserve the right to review the content submitted and, in rare cases, take it down. This is really reserved for blatant spam that is entering the system. If one puts an open form somewhere on the interwebs, it eventually does get populated with some rather interesting materials.
    </p>

    <p>
      We would like to promote both the events you submit on our service via social media, print, etc. In addition, we would like to generate reports based on events submitted. This allows us to effectively advise both private and public entities on issues related to arts and culture. For these purposes, we are asking that you give us the rights to the submitted content.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>We strive to be good humans.</em> We will never reveal ANY personal information to a third-party. That is simply not in our code. The project is open-source so this statement is truly independently verifiable.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not track you with our "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWw7Wd2gUJk" target="_blank">cookies</a>". These are bits of code that sit on your machine and "remember" the history of your site usage. Any use of cookies or your browser’s local storage is there to help make the experience of using the site easier and more intuitive.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do use third-party software for analytics (specifically <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://metrica.yandex.com" target="_blank">Yandex</a>) these guys do track you. We need them right now to get aggregated/anonymized user data.  For example, to see how many of visitors we get per week. This allows us to apply for grants and such (we are a non-profit after all) set solid internal goals, and track our own progress. The bits of code that these folks represent are scattered all over the internet. If you categorically have issues with them, we recommend using <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger" target="_blank">Privacy Badger</a>, <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/" target="_blank">Ghostery</a> or similar browser tech.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also use custom scripts for similar purposes. Mainly to track usage of specific UI elements, like the “add to calendar” feature. This is basically allows us to confirm that a specific feature is an important part of our service or drop its development in future versions of the site.
    </p>

    <p>
      From time to time we will need to update this document in order to keep up with the changes on the website.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s about it. Feel free to <a href="#" @click.stop="RouteTo('/contact')">reach out</a> to us if you have any additional questions.

    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>We use "cookies" to recognize your browser and taylor some experiences to your specific site use history. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are used for convenience and are in no way linked to any personally identifiable information such as your name or email address. Many web browsers allow you to block cookies.</p>

    <h4>What kind of data we collect</h4>
    <p>We collect and share with the third-parties data on events only. There is no Personally Identifiable Information passed through this process. Some of the data is shared via custom generated reports and some via API access granted to developers. </p>

    <h4>Analytics</h4>

    <p>We use Google Analytics and Yandex Metrika, which are web analytics services offered by Google and Yandex corporations respectively that tracks and report website traffic. Google and Yandex use the data collected to track and monitor the use of our website. This data is shared with other Google and Yandex services. Google and Yandex may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads for their own advertising network.</p>

    <p>We also use Yandex and custom scripts to look at how our interface is used by our audience. All the information collected this way is anonymized. In other words, we can tell that a certain feature is popular or not with our users but we have no idea whom specifically it is popular with. This allows us to make informed decisions on how we want to change our user interface and which new features to prioritize in development. </p>

    <p>Since our software is open-source, our usage of analytics software is completely transparent and independently verifiable. </p>
