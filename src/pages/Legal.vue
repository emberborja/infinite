    <div>Analytics</div>

      <p>
        We use Google Analytics Yandex Metrika, which are web analytics services offered by Google and Yandex corporations respectively that tracks and reports website traffic. Google and Yandex use the data collected to track and monitor the use of our website. This data is shared with other Google and Yandex services. Google and Yandex may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads for their own advertising network.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also use Yandex and custom scripts to look at how our interface is used by our audience. All the information collected this way is anonimized. In other words, we can tell that a certain feature is popular or not with our users but we have no idea whom specifically it is popular with. This allows us to make informed decissions on how we want to change our user interface and which changes to prioritize.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since our software is open-source, our usage of analytics software is completely transparent and independantly varifiable.
